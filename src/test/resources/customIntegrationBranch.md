# Test repository description for custom integration branch tests


Related to [JENKINS-28596 Hardcoded branch name when resolving commit messages](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-28596) we have created the _customIntegrationBranch_ test repository for testing the use case where the plugin is configured to integrate development branch changed on the custom integration branch - that is something else than master.


See the log-file `customIntegrationBranch-repo_description.log` for details on the repository.
